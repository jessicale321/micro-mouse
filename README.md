# micro-mouse
C-code that traverses a micro-mouse (robot) to the centre of any maze in the shortest possible path.
Wikipedia definition of micro-mouse is - Micromouse is an event where small robot mice solve a 16x16 maze. 

In this project, we used modified flood-fill algorith to solve the maze.
The algorithm is an iterative one which determines the shortest path to solve the maze over few iterations.
